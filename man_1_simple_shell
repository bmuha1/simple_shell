.SH NAME
.B Blue Shell
- simplified command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
A command interpreter that reads a line input as potential
command arguments to be executed accordingly.
Lines can be read interactively
(standard input) or non-interactively (piping a file). Designed to mimic Bash, but does
not handle particular bash features such as options.
.SH ARGUMENTS
The first argument from input is assumed to be an executable command file
followed by parameters taken by that command.
.B hsh
will then interpret this command, execute it, and then exit. The exit status
returned is the status of the previous command executed (status is 0 on
non-execution).
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE EXAMPLE
.PP
$ ./hsh
<^^^> /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
<^^^> exit
.PP
$
.SH NON-INTERACTIVE MODE EXAMPLE
