.SH NAME
.B Blue Shell
- simplified command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
A command interpreter that reads a line input as potential
command arguments to be executed accordingly.
Lines can be read interactively
(standard input) or non-interactively (piping a file). Designed to mimic Bash, but does
not handle particular bash features such as options.
.SH ARGUMENTS
The first argument from input is assumed to be an executable command file
followed by parameters taken by that command.
.B hsh
will then interpret this command, execute it, and then exit. The exit status
returned is the status of the previous command executed (status is 0 on
non-execution).
.SH INTERACTIVE MODE EXAMPLE

.PP
$ ./hsh
.PP
<^^^> /bin/ls

These strings are known as enviromental variables and are represented in the form
.B name=value
.
.SH COMMENTS
Words/characters from the line input following a
.B #
will be ignored.

.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS
Commands that are called and handled directly in the shell and thus do not need
to call upon a child process to be executed. With the execption of the exit
command, builtin commands return an exit status of
0 on successful execution and 2 on failure.
